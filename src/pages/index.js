          I product manage, design, and build, sometimes all at the same time. From 2014-2018, I worked as a software developer doing full-stack work, mostly frontend. During that time, I co-founded an art-tech agency called <a href="http://girlfriends.site" target="new">Girlfriends Labs</a>. Since 2017, I have worked as a Product Manager, first at <a href="http://siberia.io" target="new">Siberia</a> and then at the <a href="http://drl.io" target="new">Drone Racing League</a>.
