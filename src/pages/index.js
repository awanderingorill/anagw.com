        <p>
          From 2014-2018, I worked as a software developer doing full-stack work, mostly frontend. During that time, I co-founded an art-tech agency called <a href="http://girlfriends.site" target="new">Girlfriends Labs</a>. Since 2018, I have worked as a Product Manager, first at <a href="http://siberia.io" target="new">Siberia</a> and then at the <a href="http://drl.io" target="new">Drone Racing League</a>.

          2020 has been a year of reflection for me, and I realized that I really miss building things hands-on.
          Iâ€™m currently looking for a remote full-stack software engineering position focused on frontend. Let's talk! ðŸ’«
